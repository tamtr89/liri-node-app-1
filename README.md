# Introducing **Liri**, the world's lamest personal assistant.

Why speak to a "smart" device, when you can whip open a terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, make sure node is running and carefully type in the name of an application that you'll never remember?

Here's to use Liri:

1. From within the liri directory, type `node liri`.
2. Make a selection from the menu.
3. Clean up the floor after your mind has been blown.
